# My First GitHub Project: Python Calculator

This repository contains a simple command-line calculator program written in Python. This project was created as part of a learning exercise to understand Git and GitHub functionalities, including commits, branches, merges, and pull requests.

## Features

* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)
* Handles invalid non-numeric input.
* Prevents division by zero.
* Allows multiple calculations until the user chooses to exit.

## How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  **Clone the Repository (or navigate to your local copy):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/EmanKhaliq49/my-first-project-github.git]
    ```
    
3.  **Run the Calculator:**
    ```bash
    python calculator.py
    ```
4.  Follow the prompts in your terminal.

## Project Structure

* `calculator.py`: The main Python script containing the calculator logic.
* `README.md`: This file, explaining the project.
* `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.

## How it Works

The `calculator.py` script defines functions for each arithmetic operation. It then enters a loop to continuously ask the user for two numbers and an operation choice. Basic error handling is included for non-numeric input and division by zero.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3
